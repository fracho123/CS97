In order to investigate when and how this statement was introduced to
the tzdb files, I decided to search through all of the commits for the
exact string in order to find the date and author of the statement
relative to the repository. I used the following command:

git log --source -S 'Even newspaper reports present contradictory
information.' --all

This outputs the repository's commits that contain the string 'Even
newspaper reports present contradicotry information.' The argument
option --all makes it so that all commits are searched.

According to the commit description, this was authored by Arthur David
Olson and was commited by Eggert on July 18, 2012. It returned the git
commit id of c12b432741eed9a422fbf99fa27af6e7a941d88b. Next, using the
first seven letters of this id allowed me to observe the changes this
commit made to the repository:

git diff c12b432~ c12b432

using C-s on this following comparison screen allowed for me to search
for the location of the string. The paragraph quoting this string
starts with: "From Paul Eggert (1995-12-19):", suggesting Eggert was
the one to quote this statement as one written by "Shanks". I would
have to find the book to investigate any copyright infringement but it
currently seems that the author was cited to some extent.
